 ## Description

I developed this project with TypeScript. It implements only the logic of an app used for micro-mobility in a metropolis.
This project was created to support the TypeScript test on [S2I](https://www.start2impact.it/master/)

## Project Components

The project uses TypeScript to define interfaces and classes that represent the various components of the system:

- **ICitta**: interface that describes the characteristics and method of the city.
- **IMezzo**:  interface that defines the characteristics and method of a vehicle.
- **IUtente**: interface that represents the information of a user.
